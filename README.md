# Full-Responsive-BlogPage-MVC-Core
 This is my web project I am working on to learn the dynamics of web.
 I will be posting my interests, aproaching philosopically to IT, programming and my thoughts and stories as a blog. 
 I am building the page for multi users because I want to provide an environment for my writer friends..

I have tried to make the project abiding by SOLID principles and SCRUM framework. 
N-Tier Architecture is applied.
Codes are recyclable, dev friend and rebuild-able.
